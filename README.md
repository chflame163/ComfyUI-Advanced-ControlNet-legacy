# ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet-legacy
A copy of [Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet), but keep version at 1807cd64e4de87dbd09198f8782832eab09996d to compatible with the weight of legacy.    
After thit version, Kosinkadink refactored CN weights to separate out input, middle, and output blocks, improved soft weight behavior to generalize math to be architecture agnostic (for the most part).    
As a result, the previous workflow inference results have undergone significant changes.
